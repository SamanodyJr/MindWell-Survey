"I finally tried my hand at baking a cake from scratch, something I’ve always wanted to do. But the cake came out dense and a bit dry, and honestly, it felt like such a waste of time and effort.

"I finally gave a speech at the community event, and I’d been so nervous for weeks. I stumbled over a few words, and now all I can think about is how it must’ve looked to everyone.

"I tried joining a new hiking group today, hoping it would be a fun way to meet people, but it ended up being so awkward. I didn’t hit it off with anyone right away, and the whole hike felt uncomfortable. If I can’t connect with people immediately, maybe I’m just not cut out for group activities like this. I thought it’d be easy to make friends, but now it feels pointless to keep trying",All or nothing thinking
