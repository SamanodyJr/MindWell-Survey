But after fumbling through my presentation and missing a couple of key points, I feel like I completely failed.

Maybe this isnâ€™t worth my time after all if I canâ€™t have a real impact.",

"I always give up at the thought of having to 'compete,' for lack of a better way to word it; most especially in the context of relationships. It always plays out like this: I end up liking someone, I make advances, find out other people are interested in them (they don't even have to feel strongly about them), feel like I'll lose anyway (even when I know I have the upper hand), give up and lose interest. I acknowledge that's a negative mindset to have and it will get me nowhere fast (as it already has), but I guess my reasoning is that I'd much rather go elsewhere where I am guaranteed a favorable result. How do I get over it? How do people even end up with these kinds of mindsets? I don't know if it's deep-seated jealousy, insecurity, maybe even trauma(??) or even just an aversion to losing.",

"I'll get to a point where people think I'm doing decent enough to tell me.  So I'll keep trying to improve and do harder things in that category, and get stuck on something I can't do.   And then I quit. 

For example, I picked up kick boxing a while ago.  I loved it and made quick strides.  Then I realised my hooks weren't so great and started trying to fix them, and nothing I did worked.  After hours and hours of trying, nothing did anything to improve them, and I started developing a mental block where internally I just kept going 'I can't do this, it's useless, this is impossible'.  And eventually I just gave up the entire thing.

It's happened with so many things.  Music composition.  Cooking.  I'm not sure what it is and how to get around it, but anytime I try pick up something and get to 'that point', I turn into a defeatist and eventually quit.  

I just would like to know what's going on and how to change it.  I've tried positive self talk and stuff like 'you can do this', all that happens is I feel even more crushed when I can't.",

"I have this really annoying habit that every time I hang out with friends / have talks with people, afterwards i start obsessing over every word that came out of my mouth. 'Maybe i shouldn't have said that' 'Maybe i should have reacted differently'... It's so tiring and it always lasts at least the next day and makes me incredibly anxious. I just want to relax and not feel like I'm a total idiot by just interacting with others. I try to constantly fight it by telling myself i did nothing wrong, but the moment i don't fight it, i get back on the anxiety circle. 
 
Can anyone relate? 

And if anyone has any helpful tips, that'd be appreciated!",
"A few days ago, I really felt like getting some ice cream and I saw an ice cream shop down the road. Walking towards it, I was arguing with myself to do or not to do it. Would it be weird? Getting ice cream on my own? Who does that? I almost walked by, but something inside myself told me 'who cares, even if they think it's weird, you don't know these people and probably will never see them again'. I turned of my thoughts, got in line... And got some ice cream! It was great.",

I'm tired of people making you feel like a pervert because you dared be interested in someone who exists outside your phone screen. I'm tired of things going well and then suddenly poof it's gone because they found someone better in some superficial way. I'm tired of being told I'm  too good for them  and  so many people would be so happy to be with me  I'm tired of people not being honest, not communicating, protecting themselves from discomfort and confrontation at levels bordering on sociopathy.

"I'm 26. Within the past 7 weeks I've lost my job, $48k in the stock market, my car got totaled, and had to move back in with my mom. Mom lives in a 2 bedroom apartment and I'm sleeping in my little sisters room while she's away at college, when she gets back I'll be on the couch. 

I've been applying for jobs for about a month and it's like no one wants to hire me, although I did put my pride aside and applied for a $16/hr retail job and already did the interview, but still waiting on even them to reach back out if I'm hired or not. 

Moms constantly nagging and it feels like I'm 16 again. I feel depressed, lonely, & unmotivated to do anything. There's only a couple friends left here in my hometown that haven't moved, they have been supportive as hell, yet I still feel disconnected. 

Easter was yesterday and the whole family seemed a bit on edge or uncomfortable when talking to me, like they were walking on eggshells almost. That really hit for me because we all normally get along and joke around during family events but I could just feel their judgement oozing. 

Straight up I've never felt like a such a bum pos in my life and it's like I'm starting to drown in a depression and i don't know what the fuck to do from here.",

Luckily i have my significant other but i still long for friends. This spring i had a long sick leave from work, due to feelings of depression and overburdened/strained from my job. I really tried to get on psychologist to seek help with untangling my past's traumas to get better understanding why i am what i am on present day, but the only thing they do is write me prescription for antidepressants. And that road i dont want to step on, because atleast right now work, running and my significant other prevents me to fall on total despair.

I think it's time I just give up. I've never really had but one friend. My wife who died at 23. My family abused and abandoned me since I was a child. I'm 38 now. I've been through so much more than this. Things will never be ok for me.,

"When giving advice to FA people I always say that the only two logical options you have are to either improve your situation to where you're not FA anymore or accept it and learn to live without anyone. I think I'm starting to realize that option B is the one I'm going to pick.

I'm not saying I want to stop improving myself, as that's something I plan to continue doing for as long as I can, but if I'm being honest with myself, I don't see my romantic life ever going anywhere. I'm physically unattractive, very short, genetically disabled, I have niche interests, I'm weird with stuff like people touching me, using my stuff etc., I'm terrible at meeting new people, and I tend to push the people I already know away with my personality for some reason :(   (although I'm aware the last one can be changed and I'm working on it)

Did any of you embrace the fact that you're likely never gonna find a significant other and that planning your life around it isn't a good idea due to how unlikely it is? How did you manage that and what helped you accept it? 

My main idea for now is to try making and keeping at least a few platonic acquaintances so that I don't go mentally insane from lack of socialization.",
"Im a 21 year old student who decided to move abroad to study. I really learnt a lot during my time here, developed and grew as a person and I'm really happy of what I've become during these years abroad. The problem is it gets really lonely although I have a bunch of friends here. It's like I can't connect with my friends here on a deeper level as I'd done with my childhood buddies back home. I've always been the type of person who takes their time when it comes to getting to know new people and sometimes I don't bother to put the extra effort to be involved in somebody's life and like to keep things natural as in whatever happens happens and if nothing happens its not meant to be. Idk if it's the best mentality when it comes to relationships but back home it was all good and I've never had this feeling of loneliness that I'm experiencing here.",

But then I realize that being 'creepy' is merely a euphemism for being ugly and I've learnt my place the hard way already so I end up feeling like shit for having these desires. God, I wish I weren't such an ugly piece of shit. At least those fantasies would at least be a reality to begin with",

"When I say extrovert, I mean extrovert, not someone who is just a bit more social than the average joe. Most people aren't introverts or extroverts, but something in between. 

Extroverts don't really have it very easy like Reddit portrays it as. We get incredibly lonely and sad, very fast, without social interaction. Even just one day without a lot of social interaction and I get kind of gloomy and sad. Let alone 3-4 days, let alone a week. 

The same way introverts 'regain energy' by being alone, we regain energy by socializing. Except its much easier to be alone than it is to socialize, especially as we get older and people stop hanging out with friends as much. 

Now try all that, but also having social anxiety, and its a literal hell. I've gotten over my anxiety problems for the most part, but before it was awful. I would REALLY badly want to socialize, like desperately, but also be scared to socialize. I would sometimes get too anxious to go out and then spend the entire rest of the night just feeling horribly angry at myself for not going out. 

Being an extrovert isn't easy. At all. ",
"These two feelings I know all too well. Whenever I set a plan in motion and fail to do a step, they are there to remind me of my failure. I know they are there to make me work harder, but they are also the cause of unearned depression fits. Like, I might not be perfect, nobody is, but when I rely on shame and guilt as motivators, they only reffirm my feelings of inadequacy. I would rather base my motivation on my achievements rather than failures. What is your experience with these two emotions? Are they even helpful? Or do they lead to more harm than good? I am relly interested in your answer and where you find your motivation for self-improvement journey.",

Yet, I feel for genuine human connection, it's like I want to feel heard, but I have no idea how to communicate my message bypassing small talks.

"To make It short, I started College just in the middle of the pandemic, decided to go for Software Engineering. I fell into the mindset of 'well, I'm not using this for the test of the career' so I started cheating for every single Calculus and Physics exams. Started just Asking my Friends for answer, to paying someone to do my stuff. Got caught by the time I was taking Calculus 4, got a 0 on that exam. And promised myself to never cheat again after that semester.

It was my lowest point as a person, I don't justify what I did. I know It was wrong, and were horrible actions

But now, almost 4 years later here I am, destroying myself because I can't handle the guilt. My Friends and family are well aware of this, but when I try to Talk about what I feel they just say most of the times they just say 'It's in the past' 'a lot of people did the same', or they straight ignore It.

This has gotten to a point where I had thoughts of ending my own Life two months ago, thank God I am way too coward to actually do  that.

In other words, I'm an irresponsible immature person surrounded by people who work a hundred thousand times harder than me.
What was the difference between their parents and my parents? Simple, 10 years ago when I was in elementary school they gave me gifts without me working and never prepared me to be a member of that minority of hard workers who work hard from a young age.
