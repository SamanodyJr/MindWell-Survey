samanody,"Today was supposed to be the big day—my chance to prove I could handle leading the project at work. But after fumbling through my presentation and missing a couple of key points, I feel like I completely failed. I don’t think anyone took me seriously; maybe I’m just not cut out for leadership after all. It’s frustrating because I wanted to show them I had it all together, but now I feel like I’m back at square one.",All or Nothing Thinking,Emotional reasoning,
samanody,"I spent weeks prepping for this half-marathon, thinking it would be the start of a new chapter for me. But today I had to stop halfway because my knee started hurting, and now it feels like the whole thing was pointless. I can’t believe I couldn’t even finish; maybe I was never meant to be a runner. All that effort, and for what? I’m not sure I’ll bother trying again",Fortune telling (also called catastrophizing),Mind reading,
samanody,"I finally hosted a dinner party, something I’ve wanted to do for ages, but it didn’t go like I planned. The main course was undercooked, and a couple of people barely touched their plates. I feel like such a failure as a host—if I can’t even get one evening right, what’s the point in trying again? I thought this would be a fun way to connect with friends, but now it just feels embarrassing.",Mind reading,Control fallacies,
samanody,"Today was my first day volunteering at the shelter, and honestly, I thought it would feel more rewarding. Instead, I spent most of my time cleaning and doing little tasks that didn’t seem to matter. I guess I’m not actually making any real difference here if that’s all I’m able to contribute. Maybe this isn’t worth my time after all if I can’t have a real impact.",Labeling,Emotional reasoning,
samanody,"I finally tried my hand at baking a cake from scratch, something I’ve always wanted to do. But the cake came out dense and a bit dry, and honestly, it felt like such a waste of time and effort. If I can’t even bake one cake well, maybe I’m just not cut out for this at all. I wanted it to turn out perfect, and now I’m wondering if I should stick to simpler things",All or Nothing Thinking,Labeling,
samanody,"I finally gave a speech at the community event, and I’d been so nervous for weeks. I stumbled over a few words, and now all I can think about is how it must’ve looked to everyone. I really thought I’d be able to speak confidently, but I ended up feeling like a complete mess up there. Maybe I’m just not meant for public speaking at all—either I’m amazing at it, or there’s no point.",Labeling,Emotional reasoning,
samanody,"I’ve been studying for this certification exam for months, but after today’s practice test, I’m feeling hopeless. I missed way more questions than I thought I would, and now I’m starting to think I’ll never pass. I wanted to feel like I was on top of it by now, but I can’t help but feel like I’m failing completely. Maybe this whole goal was unrealistic from the start",Fortune telling (also called catastrophizing),Mental Filter,
samanody,"I tried joining a new hiking group today, hoping it would be a fun way to meet people, but it ended up being so awkward. I didn’t hit it off with anyone right away, and the whole hike felt uncomfortable. If I can’t connect with people immediately, maybe I’m just not cut out for group activities like this. I thought it’d be easy to make friends, but now it feels pointless to keep trying",All or Nothing Thinking,Fortune telling (also called catastrophizing),
samanody,"Today was my first day trying yoga, and honestly, it didn’t go how I’d hoped. I couldn’t keep up with most of the poses, and I felt out of place next to everyone who seemed so natural at it. I thought I’d feel calm and capable, but instead, I left feeling like I completely failed. Maybe I’m just not cut out for this kind of thing—either I get it right from the start, or it’s not worth it",Emotional reasoning,All or Nothing Thinking,
samanody,"I tried cooking a new recipe tonight, hoping it would be a nice surprise for everyone, but it turned out bland, and nobody seemed that impressed. I thought I could pull it off, but I guess I don’t have what it takes to make something special. It feels like if I can’t make a perfect meal, there’s no point in even trying. I wanted it to be great, but instead, it just feels like I shouldn’t have bothered.",Mental Filter,All or Nothing Thinking,

I can picture it now—awkward silences, nobody really talking to me, just me standing alone by the snack table, wishing I hadn’t come.
