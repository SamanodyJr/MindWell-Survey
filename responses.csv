W25-MA01,"I always give up at the thought of having to 'compete,' for lack of a better way to word it; most especially in the context of relationships. It always plays out like this: I end up liking someone, I make advances, find out other people are interested in them (they don't even have to feel strongly about them), feel like I'll lose anyway (even when I know I have the upper hand), give up and lose interest. I acknowledge that's a negative mindset to have and it will get me nowhere fast (as it already has), but I guess my reasoning is that I'd much rather go elsewhere where I am guaranteed a favorable result. How do I get over it? How do people even end up with these kinds of mindsets? I don't know if it's deep-seated jealousy, insecurity, maybe even trauma(??) or even just an aversion to losing.",Select the Cognitive Distortion,Select another Cognitive Distortion or None,
W25-MA01,"Him: Never?

Me: No, never.

Him: No flirting, no fooling around, none of that?

Me, dying inside once again: No, nothing.

EDIT: We were talking about my life and when we got to adolescence he appeared shocked that I hadn't started flirting with girls at 14-15. It's been a decade and I don't even flirt today. I made a therapist shocked. Man do I hate myself.",Select the Cognitive Distortion,Select another Cognitive Distortion or None,
W25-MA01,"I'll get to a point where people think I'm doing decent enough to tell me.  So I'll keep trying to improve and do harder things in that category, and get stuck on something I can't do.   And then I quit. 

For example, I picked up kick boxing a while ago.  I loved it and made quick strides.  Then I realised my hooks weren't so great and started trying to fix them, and nothing I did worked.  After hours and hours of trying, nothing did anything to improve them, and I started developing a mental block where internally I just kept going 'I can't do this, it's useless, this is impossible'.  And eventually I just gave up the entire thing.

It's happened with so many things.  Music composition.  Cooking.  I'm not sure what it is and how to get around it, but anytime I try pick up something and get to 'that point', I turn into a defeatist and eventually quit.  

I just would like to know what's going on and how to change it.  I've tried positive self talk and stuff like 'you can do this', all that happens is I feel even more crushed when I can't.",Select the Cognitive Distortion,Select another Cognitive Distortion or None,
W25-MA01,"It's not going one weekend without having anything to do.  It's going week after week, month after, month, without anything to.  And it's like that for years.  

It's spending every Saturday and Friday alone, as the hour torturously crawl by.  

I had more to say but I'm so exhausted and tired from boredom I can't even bother to type more",Select the Cognitive Distortion,Select another Cognitive Distortion or None,
W25-MA01,"I have this really annoying habit that every time I hang out with friends / have talks with people, afterwards i start obsessing over every word that came out of my mouth. 'Maybe i shouldn't have said that' 'Maybe i should have reacted differently'... It's so tiring and it always lasts at least the next day and makes me incredibly anxious. I just want to relax and not feel like I'm a total idiot by just interacting with others. I try to constantly fight it by telling myself i did nothing wrong, but the moment i don't fight it, i get back on the anxiety circle. 
 
Can anyone relate? 

And if anyone has any helpful tips, that'd be appreciated!",Select the Cognitive Distortion,Select another Cognitive Distortion or None,
W25-MA01,"A few days ago, I really felt like getting some ice cream and I saw an ice cream shop down the road. Walking towards it, I was arguing with myself to do or not to do it. Would it be weird? Getting ice cream on my own? Who does that? I almost walked by, but something inside myself told me 'who cares, even if they think it's weird, you don't know these people and probably will never see them again'. I turned of my thoughts, got in line... And got some ice cream! It was great.",Select the Cognitive Distortion,Select another Cognitive Distortion or None,
W25-MA01,"I'm tired of getting lead on by people who are happy to chat aimlessly for days or weeks through text or on dating apps but disappear once you ask to meet in person. I'm tired of people waffling about and getting your hopes up only to fade away and make you feel like a crazy loser. I'm tired of people making you feel like a pervert because you dared be interested in someone who exists outside your phone screen. I'm tired of things going well and then suddenly poof it's gone because they found someone better in some superficial way. I'm tired of being told I'm  too good for them  and  so many people would be so happy to be with me  I'm tired of people not being honest, not communicating, protecting themselves from discomfort and confrontation at levels bordering on sociopathy. I'm done. I'm not trying anymore. Me and my dog are gonna live the good life and no one else is invited. ",Select the Cognitive Distortion,Select another Cognitive Distortion or None,
W25-MA01,"I'm 26. Within the past 7 weeks I've lost my job, $48k in the stock market, my car got totaled, and had to move back in with my mom. Mom lives in a 2 bedroom apartment and I'm sleeping in my little sisters room while she's away at college, when she gets back I'll be on the couch. 

I've been applying for jobs for about a month and it's like no one wants to hire me, although I did put my pride aside and applied for a $16/hr retail job and already did the interview, but still waiting on even them to reach back out if I'm hired or not. 

Moms constantly nagging and it feels like I'm 16 again. I feel depressed, lonely, & unmotivated to do anything. There's only a couple friends left here in my hometown that haven't moved, they have been supportive as hell, yet I still feel disconnected. 

Easter was yesterday and the whole family seemed a bit on edge or uncomfortable when talking to me, like they were walking on eggshells almost. That really hit for me because we all normally get along and joke around during family events but I could just feel their judgement oozing. 

Straight up I've never felt like a such a bum pos in my life and it's like I'm starting to drown in a depression and i don't know what the fuck to do from here.",Select the Cognitive Distortion,Select another Cognitive Distortion or None,
