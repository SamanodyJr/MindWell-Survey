But after fumbling through my presentation and missing a couple of key points, I feel like I completely failed. I don’t think anyone took me seriously; maybe I’m just not cut out for leadership after all.

But today I had to stop halfway because my knee started hurting, and now it feels like the whole thing was pointless. I can’t believe I couldn’t even finish; maybe I was never meant to be a runner. All that effort, and for what? I’m not sure I’ll bother trying again|I finally hosted a dinner party, something I’ve wanted to do for ages, but it didn’t go like I planned. The main course was undercooked, and a couple of people barely touched their plates. I feel like such a failure as a host—if I can’t even get one evening right, what’s the point in trying again? I thought this would be a fun way to connect with friends, but now it just feels embarrassing.|Today was my first day volunteering at the shelter, and honestly, I thought it would feel more rewarding. Instead, I spent most of my time cleaning and doing little tasks that didn’t seem to matter. I guess I’m not actually making any real difference here if that’s all I’m able to contribute. Maybe this isn’t worth my time after all if I can’t have a real impact.|I finally tried my hand at baking a cake from scratch, something I’ve always wanted to do. But the cake came out dense and a bit dry, and honestly, it felt like such a waste of time and effort. If I can’t even bake one cake well, maybe I’m just not cut out for this at all. I wanted it to turn out perfect, and now I’m wondering if I should stick to simpler things|I finally gave a speech at the community event, and I’d been so nervous for weeks. I stumbled over a few words, and now all I can think about is how it must’ve looked to everyone. I really thought I’d be able to speak confidently, but I ended up feeling like a complete mess up there. Maybe I’m just not meant for public speaking at all—either I’m amazing at it, or there’s no point.|I’ve been studying for this certification exam for months, but after today’s practice test, I’m feeling hopeless. I missed way more questions than I thought I would, and now I’m starting to think I’ll never pass. I wanted to feel like I was on top of it by now, but I can’t help but feel like I’m failing completely. Maybe this whole goal was unrealistic from the start|I tried joining a new hiking group today, hoping it would be a fun way to meet people, but it ended up being so awkward. I didn’t hit it off with anyone right away, and the whole hike felt uncomfortable. If I can’t connect with people immediately, maybe I’m just not cut out for group activities like this. I thought it’d be easy to make friends, but now it feels pointless to keep trying|Today was my first day trying yoga, and honestly, it didn’t go how I’d hoped. I couldn’t keep up with most of the poses, and I felt out of place next to everyone who seemed so natural at it. I thought I’d feel calm and capable, but instead, I left feeling like I completely failed. Maybe I’m just not cut out for this kind of thing—either I get it right from the start, or it’s not worth it|I tried cooking a new recipe tonight, hoping it would be a nice surprise for everyone, but it turned out bland, and nobody seemed that impressed. I thought I could pull it off, but I guess I don’t have what it takes to make something special. It feels like if I can’t make a perfect meal, there’s no point in even trying. I wanted it to be great, but instead, it just feels like I shouldn’t have bothered."
dana,gouda,"I have that big meeting tomorrow, and I just know it’s going to go terribly.

I keep trying to stay calm, but it feels like the bad news is just waiting for me.|I finally sent out a few job applications, and now I’m almost regretting it.

piymn,ashkar,"After today’s meeting, I just know my team doesn’t respect me. I felt so out of place, like I was just stumbling over my words and nobody really cared what I had to say.

I’m starting to think I shouldn’t even be here.|I don’t know why, but I feel so distant from my friend group lately. Every time we hang out, I get this feeling that they don’t actually want me there, like I’m just tagging along. I know it’s probably silly, but if I keep feeling this way, there has to be some truth to it. Maybe they’ve just outgrown me, and I haven’t realized it until now.|I’ve been feeling anxious about my relationship lately, and it makes me think that something must be wrong between us. Every time we talk, I have this uneasy feeling, like there’s a disconnect I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s almost like we’re drifting apart, even if nothing specific has happened. I can’t help but think that if I’m feeling this way, it has to mean there’s something real to worry about.|I walked into that networking event and immediately felt like I didn’t belong. Everyone else seemed so confident, like they all had something valuable to offer, while I just felt out of place.

Maybe I’m not really cut out for this industry after all.|Today in class, I felt totally lost while the professor was explaining the new material. Everyone else looked like they were following along just fine, while I was struggling to make sense of it. It makes me think that I’m just not smart enough to keep up with this subject.
