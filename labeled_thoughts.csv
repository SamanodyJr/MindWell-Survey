"After today’s meeting, I just know my team doesn’t respect me. I felt so out of place, like I was just stumbling over my words and nobody really cared what I had to say. It’s clear they don’t see me as competent, or I wouldn’t have felt so uneasy. I don’t even know why I try when it’s obvious I don’t fit in with them.",Mind reading,Fortune telling (also called catastrophizing)
"Ever since I started this new role, I’ve felt completely lost, and it just confirms I’m not cut out for this job. Every time I try to work on a project, I feel overwhelmed and unsure, like I’m already failing. If I feel this uncertain all the time, it must mean I’m not capable. I’m starting to think I shouldn’t even be here.",Mental Filter,Emotional reasoning
"I don’t know why, but I feel so distant from my friend group lately. Every time we hang out, I get this feeling that they don’t actually want me there, like I’m just tagging along. I know it’s probably silly, but if I keep feeling this way, there has to be some truth to it. Maybe they’ve just outgrown me, and I haven’t realized it until now.",All or Nothing Thinking,All or Nothing Thinking
"I’ve been feeling anxious about my relationship lately, and it makes me think that something must be wrong between us. Every time we talk, I have this uneasy feeling, like there’s a disconnect I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s almost like we’re drifting apart, even if nothing specific has happened. I can’t help but think that if I’m feeling this way, it has to mean there’s something real to worry about.",All or Nothing Thinking,All or Nothing Thinking
"I walked into that networking event and immediately felt like I didn’t belong. Everyone else seemed so confident, like they all had something valuable to offer, while I just felt out of place. I can’t shake the feeling that this line of work just isn’t for me—if it were, I wouldn’t feel so uncomfortable. Maybe I’m not really cut out for this industry after all.",All or Nothing Thinking,All or Nothing Thinking
"Today in class, I felt totally lost while the professor was explaining the new material. Everyone else looked like they were following along just fine, while I was struggling to make sense of it. It makes me think that I’m just not smart enough to keep up with this subject. If I’m feeling this confused now, I doubt I’ll ever really get it.",All or Nothing Thinking,All or Nothing Thinking
"I had lunch with my cousin today, but the whole time, I couldn’t shake this uncomfortable feeling, like she didn’t really want to be there. She didn’t seem very talkative, and I kept feeling like maybe I was annoying her. If I’m picking up on this, it must mean she doesn’t actually enjoy spending time with me anymore. It’s disappointing, but I guess people just grow apart",All or Nothing Thinking,All or Nothing Thinking
"I’ve been feeling so exhausted at work lately, like I can’t keep up with everything. It just makes me think that I’m not cut out for this position, that maybe I’m in over my head. If I’m constantly feeling drained, it must mean I’m not handling things as well as I should be. I wonder if everyone else senses that I’m struggling, even if they haven’t said anything",All or Nothing Thinking,All or Nothing Thinking
"I tried reaching out to an old friend today, but for some reason, I felt this heaviness the entire time, like we’d already grown too far apart. It just felt like we were speaking different languages, even though nothing specific happened. I can’t help but think that this feeling means our friendship isn’t really there anymore. Maybe it’s time to accept that some people just aren’t meant to stay in your life",All or Nothing Thinking,All or Nothing Thinking
"I spent some time with my new colleagues today, but the whole time I felt like I was out of place, like I just didn’t fit in with them. They seemed friendly enough, but I couldn’t shake this feeling that I didn’t really belong. I guess if I feel this way, it must mean I’m just not a good match for this team. Maybe they’re just being polite, and deep down, they see it too.",All or Nothing Thinking,All or Nothing Thinking
